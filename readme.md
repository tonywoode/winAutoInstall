winAutoInstall (a.k.a my win-dots)
==================================

what's this?
------------
Just my auto-install scripts for a windows machine,
a mix of dev and emulation-related concerns. Move along.....

features (aka: is there anything useful in this repo for anyone else?)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
* Maybe for the Virtual Drives setup tool - using subst for indirection is good,
	but gets interesting with elevation levels, drive labeling, and permanance
	(uses [Elevation scripts](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2007.06.utilityspotlight.aspx?) by Michael Murgolo
* Chocolatey - just a simple auto install and update script
* Firefox profile - we must keep track of our firefox folder, a firefox account only cares about passwords and such
* dots - its not easy on windows to symlink dot files, nevertheless we should keep e.g.: git config files portable
