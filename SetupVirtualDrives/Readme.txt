I like to use virtual drives and I like to use HFS volumes
I host all my code on such a virtually-mapped volume
This sets up a few mappings such as that one

To run:
1) Move Run_Me_Firrt_Time... to the desktop
2) Run him as administrator
3) Restart
4) Run Initialise Drives (as now you will be able to run administrative commands against things in this folder set)
5) Run the other scripts on here
