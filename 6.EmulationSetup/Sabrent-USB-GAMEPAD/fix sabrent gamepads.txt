*****A warning to anyone buying these pads*****

I have purchased two of these pads from two different sellers, both came as faulty. What I mean by this is, the buttons needed a lot of pressure to recognize the connection. This is defiantly a manufacture fault but this can be fixed easily if you dare void the warranty and open it.

What you will need to fix this product:
- Cleaning alcohol
- Ear Buds
- One sheet of A4 paper

1. Carefully open the pad by removing the 6 screws on the back.
2. Remove all membrane from the pad and rub each and everyone on the A4 paper until all membranes have produced a 5cm line.
3. On all the PCB's button contacts use the cleaning alcohol, put a fair bit on the ear buds and clean each contact.
4. Dry contacts with dry side of ear bud
5. put pad back together but don't screw
6. Plug in USB and test pad under game pad in control panel.
7. If all buttons work fine after this fix screw the pad back together and have fun. If not, rub the membrane more on the paper.

I think all these pad's have been shipped with faulty membrane's which don't conduct electricity properly until they are warn down a bit. Also shows
